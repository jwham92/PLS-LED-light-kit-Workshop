# PLS-LED-light-kit-Workshop

Hi guys,
We are going to start to learn How to use Arduino LED light kit.

    1. Set up Software

    First of all, Please download the latest version (1. 8. 12) of Arduino IDE from the site (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) - We are going to use the application, not the web editor!

    Next, Run the Arduino application.
    Download two zip files from the PLS folder in google drive (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PKxx06rJQPptyXUj5kmCqwzHPSszRdcL)
